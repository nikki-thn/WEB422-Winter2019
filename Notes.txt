Angular: Angular(2009) -> AngularJS(2012-2013) -> Angular v2: idea is same but detailed implementation has changed
Angular vs React: both components based, front-end
React: focus more on UI
Angular: a complete app dev platform using TypeScript (an extention of JS). Code in TypeScript and later translate to JS (similar to SASS -> CSS)

ng new my-dream-app --routing -S //create an angular app with routing and no unit testong

App entry point: src/index.html
TS entry point: main.ts, src/app/app.Module.ts (every codes will inject into app.modile.ts automatically)
First component: app.component.ts (in the file, component name is my-np-app)

TypeScript (created by Microsoft) has data type restricted feature (optional). Ex:
  type:String = "Hello world"
  type:String[] = []; //array of String
  
 
 Angular Architecture Overview:
  Angular building blocks:
  1. Modules: ie. In app.module.ts file, we see @NgModule
  2. One module -> Components: ie. In app.component.ts, we see @component
