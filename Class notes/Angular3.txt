===== Angular Routing =====
CLI: ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app 
--flat puts the file in src/app instead of its own folder.
--module=app tells the CLI to register it in the imports array of the AppModule


====== Angular Deployment =====
ng build //to deploy with the base is the root folder????
.map : file extention that is the minimize version of js file

ng build --base-href=/my/app/ .  //change the base folder to the specified directory

ng build --prod // build product with optimization features as listed, better for performance

Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation: pre-compiles Angular component templates.
Production mode: deploys the production environment which enables production mode.
Bundling: concatenates your many application and library files into a few bundles.
Minification: removes excess whitespace, comments, and optional tokens.
Uglification: rewrites code to use short, cryptic variable and function names.
Dead code elimination: removes unreferenced modules and much unused code.
The remaining copy deployment steps are the same as before.


====== Angular Testing ========
//// Unit Testing: testing if property or methods returns correct values
//Angular unit testing (testing components)
//e-2-e (end-to-end) testing functionality

app.component.spec.ts //default test file for a component, this case, for the "app" component
A spec: a test that is written Jasmine

ng test // to run a .spec.ts or a test file
ng e2e // to run a e2e test
